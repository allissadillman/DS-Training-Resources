# Data Science Training Resources

## R resources

* [RStudio Primers](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers): Learn data science basics using these R cloud interactive tutorials.  Topics include everything from data tidying to building interactive apps.
	
* [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/): This is an online book that will teach you how to do data science with R: You’ll learn how to get your data into R, get it into the most useful structure, transform it, visualize it and model it. In this book, you will find a practicum of skills for data science.

* [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday): Join the R4DS Online Learning Community in the weekly #TidyTuesday event! Every week they post a raw dataset, a chart or article related to that dataset, and ask you to explore the data. The goal of TidyTuesday is to apply your R skills, get feedback, explore other’s work, and connect with the greater #RStats community.

* [Data Carpentry for Biologists](https://datacarpentry.org/semester-biology/nav/getting-started/): This website hosts introductory material for teaching biologists how to interact with data including: data structure, database management systems, and programming for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. Most of the modules use R.

* [Statistical Methods for Functional Genomics](https://seandavi.github.io/ITR/): This site share materials for the CSHL Statistical Methods for Functional Genomics, which uses R and bioconductor.

* [Statistics with R Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/statistics): Master Statistics with R in this Coursera specialization, which includes five courses covering topics like inference, modeling, and Bayesian approaches.

* [Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science): This 10-course data science specialization covers the concepts and tools you'll need throughout the entire data science pipeline, from asking the right kinds of questions to making inferences and publishing results using R.

* [Cloud Based Data Science](https://leanpub.com/universities/set/jhu/cloud-based-data-science): A free online educational to help anyone who can read, write, and use a computer to move into data science. It is a sequence of 11 Coursera courses offered by faculty members in the Johns Hopkins Department of Biostatistics, Bloomberg School of Public Health.
	
* [R Programming for Data Science](https://leanpub.com/rprogramming): This book brings the fundamentals of R programming to you, using the same material developed as part of the industry-leading Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization. The skills taught in this book will lay the foundation for you to begin your journey learning data science.

* swirl: swirl teaches you R programming and data science interactively, at your own pace, and right in the R console.

* [Exercism](https://exercism.io/tracks/r/): offers programming puzzles to solve against a provided set of test cases. Mimicking the workflow of test-driven development (TDD), Exercism emphasizes iteration and refactoring. After solving a puzzle, solutions can be discussed with a mentor and peers' solutions can be reviewed.

* [Esquisse](https://dreamrs.github.io/esquisse/index.html):  this R add-in lets you explore your data quickly to extract the information they hold.  The interactive plots also come with the code used to generate them, so it can be a useful way to learn data visualization with ggplots.

* [ggThemeAssist](https://github.com/calligross/ggthemeassist): this R add-in provides a graphical user interface for customizing ggplot2 visualization themes. You can modify the attributes of the graph in real time and this package will modify your code for the graph output.

* [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/): This tutorial will help you install Git and get it working smoothly with GitHub, in the shell and in RStudio, develop a few key workflows that cover your most common tasks, and integrate Git and GitHub into your daily work with R and RMarkdown.
