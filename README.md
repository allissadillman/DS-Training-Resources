* [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/): This is an online book that will teach you how to do data science with R: You’ll learn how to get your data into R, get it into the most useful structure, transform it, visualize it and model it. In this book, you will find a practicum of skills for data science.

* [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday): Join the R4DS Online Learning Community in the weekly #TidyTuesday event! Every week they post a raw dataset, a chart or article related to that dataset, and ask you to explore the data. The goal of TidyTuesday is to apply your R skills, get feedback, explore other’s work, and connect with the greater #RStats community.

* [Data Carpentry for Biologists](https://datacarpentry.org/semester-biology/nav/getting-started/): This website hosts introductory material for teaching biologists how to interact with data including: data structure, database management systems, and programming for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. Most of the modules use R.

* [Statistical Methods for Functional Genomics](https://seandavi.github.io/ITR/): This site share materials for the CSHL Statistical Methods for Functional Genomics, which uses R and bioconductor.

* [Statistics with R Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/statistics): Master Statistics with R in this Coursera specialization, which includes five courses covering topics like inference, modeling, and Bayesian approaches.

* [Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science): This 10-course data science specialization covers the concepts and tools you'll need throughout the entire data science pipeline, from asking the right kinds of questions to making inferences and publishing results using R.

* [Cloud Based Data Science](https://leanpub.com/universities/set/jhu/cloud-based-data-science): A free online educational to help anyone who can read, write, and use a computer to move into data science. It is a sequence of 11 Coursera courses offered by faculty members in the Johns Hopkins Department of Biostatistics, Bloomberg School of Public Health.
	
* [R Programming for Data Science](https://leanpub.com/rprogramming): This book brings the fundamentals of R programming to you, using the same material developed as part of the industry-leading Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization. The skills taught in this book will lay the foundation for you to begin your journey learning data science.

* [swirl](https://swirlstats.com/): swirl teaches you R programming and data science interactively, at your own pace, and right in the R console.

* [Exercism](https://exercism.io/tracks/r/): offers programming puzzles to solve against a provided set of test cases. Mimicking the workflow of test-driven development (TDD), Exercism emphasizes iteration and refactoring. After solving a puzzle, solutions can be discussed with a mentor and peers' solutions can be reviewed.

* [Esquisse](https://dreamrs.github.io/esquisse/index.html):  this R add-in lets you explore your data quickly to extract the information they hold.  The interactive plots also come with the code used to generate them, so it can be a useful way to learn data visualization with ggplots.

* [ggThemeAssist](https://github.com/calligross/ggthemeassist): this R add-in provides a graphical user interface for customizing ggplot2 visualization themes. You can modify the attributes of the graph in real time and this package will modify your code for the graph output.

* [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/): This tutorial will help you install Git and get it working smoothly with GitHub, in the shell and in RStudio, develop a few key workflows that cover your most common tasks, and integrate Git and GitHub into your daily work with R and RMarkdown.


## Python resources
 
* Python for Data Science and AI: This 4-module introduction to Python will kickstart your learning of Python for data science, as well as programming in general. This beginner-friendly Python course will take you from zero to programming in Python in a matter of hours.

* Data Analysis with Python: This course will take you from the basics of Python to exploring many different types of data. You will learn how to prepare data for analysis, perform simple statistical analysis, create meaningful data visualizations, predict future trends from data, and more.

* Data Visualization with Python: This course will teach you how to take data that at first glance has little meaning and present that data in a form that makes sense to people. Various techniques have been developed for presenting data visually but in this course, we will be using several data visualization libraries in Python, namely Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Folium.
 
* Machine Learning with Python: This course dives into the basics of machine learning using Python. You will learn about the purpose of Machine Learning and where it applies to the real world.  You will also get a general overview of machine learning topics such as supervised vs unsupervised learning, model evaluation, and Machine Learning algorithms.
 
* A Whirlwind Tour of Python: A fast-paced introduction to essential features of the Python language, aimed at researchers and developers who are already familiar with programming in another language. The material is particularly designed for those who wish to use Python for data science and/or scientific programming
 
* Python Challenge: In this game, each level can be solved by a bit of programming. You will be able to solve most riddles in any programming language, but some of them will require Python.
 
* Data 8: The Foundations of Data Science: This UC Berkeley Foundations of Data Science course combines three perspectives: inferential thinking, computational thinking, and real-world relevance. The course teaches critical concepts and skills in computer programming and statistical inference, in conjunction with hands-on analysis of real-world datasets, including economic data, document collections, geographical data, and social networks. It delves into social issues surrounding data analysis such as privacy and design. Python based.
 
* Automate the Boring Stuff with Python: This free e-book covers how to use Python to write programs that do in minutes what would take you hours to do by hand - no prior programming experience required. Once you've mastered the basics of programming, you'll create Python programs that effortlessly perform useful feats of automation.
 
* Practice Python: This site provides over 30 beginner Python exercises just waiting to be solved. Each exercise comes with a small discussion of a topic and a link to a solution. New exercise are posted monthly.
